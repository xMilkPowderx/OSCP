# OSCP

Just some oscp cheat sheet stuff that I customized for myself. It may look messy, I just use it to copy the command I needed easily.

The content in this repo is not meant to be a full list of commands that you will need in OSCP. It rather just a list of commands that I found them useful with a few notes on them.
